Survey details in this wealth bracket are notably incomplete, and statistics derived from tax returns often prove inadequate due to the intricate nature of wealth ownership arrangements. While the foundational layer of the wealth pyramid encompasses individuals from diverse markets at various life stages, those classified as High Net Worth (HNW) and Ultra-High Net Worth (UHNW) exhibit pronounced concentrations in specific regions and markets. Moreover, these individuals tend to lead similar lifestyles and participate in global luxury markets, even if residing on different continents. Their wealth portfolios are also expected to share similarities, with a notable emphasis on financial assets, particularly equity holdings in publicly traded international companies.</p>
<p class="txt-column intro-txt">As of the end of 2022, UBS estimates that 59.1 million HNW adults possess wealth ranging from USD 1 million to USD 50 million, with the majority (51.5 million) falling within the USD 1-5 million range. North America claims the highest number, surpassing Europe significantly, which, in turn, hosts more than Asia-Pacific markets excluding China and India combined. China constitutes 10.5% of all HNW individuals, while Latin America, India, and Africa collectively represent only 4.0% of the total. UHNW individuals, with net assets exceeding USD 50 million, number 243,062 globally according to UBS calculations. Among individual markets, the United States leads with 51% of UHNW adults, followed distantly by China at 14% of the total UHNW membership.</p><div id="references"><p><sup>1<a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#34effbd73d78"> Forbes, The World's Real-time Billionaires</a></p><p><sup>2<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/"> Bloomberg, Bloomberg Billionaires Index</sup></a></sup></p></div>`;
